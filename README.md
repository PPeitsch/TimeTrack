## 📖 Usage

The application is organized into several key sections accessible from the main navigation bar.

### Calendar Log

This is the main interface for managing your schedule.
- View an entire month at a glance with color-coded day types.
- Click and drag to select one or more days to change their type (e.g., assign a week of vacation).
- Quickly override weekends or holidays to log work on non-standard days.

### Manual Entry

For detailed time logging on a specific day:
- Select a date and specify whether it's a workday or an absence.
- For workdays, enter multiple clock-in and clock-out times to account for breaks.

### Summary

Get a detailed overview of your logged time for any given month:
- See a summary of required hours, completed hours, and the resulting balance.
- View a day-by-day breakdown of hours worked versus required hours.

### Settings

Customize the application to fit your needs:
- Manage absence codes by adding, editing, or deleting types (e.g., "Vacation", "Sick Leave").

## 🧪 Development

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Install development dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

2. Set up pre-commit hooks:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Code Formatting

We use Black and isort for code formatting:

```bash
# Format code with Black
python -m black .

# Sort imports with isort
python -m isort --profile black .

# Run both with our helper script
python scripts/run-formatters.ps1  # Windows
./scripts/run-formatters.sh  # Linux/Mac
```
